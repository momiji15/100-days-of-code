# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
 -I decided to make a tribute page about B.K.S. Iyengar who is considered to be the "father of modern yoga." 
 -Started to work on some of the design elements. I will definitely update it as I learn more from FreeCodeCamp. 
 -In addition, I Made the headings for each section of the page.
 -Added a list of books and links.

**Thoughts:** The biggest struggle for today was figuring out who to do my Tribute Page on!

**Link to work:** N/A at the moment.
