# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
 - I decided to make a tribute page about B.K.S. Iyengar who is considered to be the "father of modern yoga." 
 - Started to work on some of the design elements. I will definitely update it as I learn more from FreeCodeCamp. 
 - In addition, I Made the headings for each section of the page.
 - Added a list of books and links.

**Thoughts:** The biggest struggle for today was figuring out who to do my Tribute Page on!

**Link to work:** N/A at the moment.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
 - I learned more about div when doing the FreeCodeCamp lessons, so I decided to spruce up my basic page and added divs in each section.
 - I found images and added a section which lists the links to those images.
 - I added three pictures to my website, but I am having trouble lining them up together using bootstrap. I will continue to work on   
   this issue tomorrow.
 
**Thoughts:** Still getting used to Bootstrap. Scratching my head and wondering what I am doing wrong...but tomorrow awaits! Time to 
               work on other stuff.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017
 
**Today's Progress**:
  - I figured out why my pictures were not lining up. It was seriously a stupid reason. I thought I had bootstrap installed, but 
   apparently not. Once I was able to do that, I was able to get them to line up.
  - I was playing around with lining up the pictures and I realized it would just be easier to make a jpeg of all the pictures I 
   wanted to add so it would look like a banner.

**Thoughts** I did get frustrated regarding the picture issue, but luckily I had an a-ha moment and realized the issue. I also need 
             to learn git sooner than later so I can make commits to my code.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
 - Learned the basics on using Git.
 - I committed yesterday's work to my repository. 
 - I added links for the "Regional Associations" and "Iyengar Yoga Blogs and Websites" sections.
 - I was going to add FontAwesome to my site,  but at this moment, I don't see why I need it.
 - I ended up adding Google Fonts to my site, and I will play around with that.
 
**Thoughts** Didn't have that many issues today. I have some baseline knowledge on using Git, so I will be using that from now on to update my work.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
 - I am still getting the hang of using Git.
 - I added jQuery to my website but I didn't add any jQuery elements to my page yet.
 - I spent most of the time trying to figure out how to align the picture I have. 
 - For some reason I cannot get the text for the title any bigger than what it is. I will work more on this tomorrow.
 
**Thoughts** The Google text size issue is seriously getting on my nerves. At least I figured out how to center the image. It wasn't 
              as easy as they make it in the tutorials!

### Day 6: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
 - I commented out of a lot of stuff so I can focus on working on adding wells to the "Regional Associations" section.
 - I finally figured out my issue with the title text size; I needed to remove the h1 tag.
 
**Thoughts** I didn't get much done because I was trying to figure out the wells issue. The main issue was just based on syntax so I really need to make sure to watch that when adding classes to divs!

### Day 7: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
- I updated the color scheme of the website.
- I added wells from all of the sections except for the "What is Iyengar Yoga?" section.

**Thoughts** Things went a lot more smoothly today compared to the other the days. I'm hoping to finish this project by the end of the week. At this point, I just need to do a little research and add content to the biography and "What is Iyengar Yoga" sections!

### Day 8: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
- I added information and a picture to the "Who is B.K.S. Iyengar" section.
- I reduced the image in the "Who is B.K.S. Iyengar" section by 50%.
- I updated the "Image sources" section.

**Thoughts** I'm not gonna lie...given how busy my day was, it was difficult to just carve out an hour to code. But the page is coming along quite nicely, so I am happy about that! I am going to try to figure out a way to upload everything so people can see what progress I am making on the page. Newbie problems!

### Day 9: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
- I changed the "Who is B.K.S. Iyengar" section to include one well and one picture in each column.
- I added additional information and one picture in the "Who is B.K.S. Iyengar" section.
- I removed one of the wells in the "Sources" section. I will just have one column/well that will store both the image and other sources.

**Thoughts** Another busy day, but I still was able to get an hour of coding in 30 minutes before midnight! The hour went by quite fast and I'm glad I could add more information in the bio section!

### Day 10: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
 - I finished the "Who is B.K.S. Iyengar" section.
 - I finished the "What is Iyengar Yoga" section.
 - I added pictures to the "What is Iyengar Yoga" and the "Who is B.K.S. Iyengar" sections.
 - I added more sources under the "image sources" section.
 - I started working on the sources section regarding the content in the "What is Iyengar Yoga" and "Who is B.K.S. Iyengar" sections.
 
**Thoughts** Started late but smooth sailing! I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel with this project!
