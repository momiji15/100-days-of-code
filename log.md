# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
 - I decided to make a tribute page about B.K.S. Iyengar who is considered to be the "father of modern yoga." 
 - Started to work on some of the design elements. I will definitely update it as I learn more from FreeCodeCamp. 
 - In addition, I Made the headings for each section of the page.
 - Added a list of books and links.

**Thoughts:** The biggest struggle for today was figuring out who to do my Tribute Page on!

**Link to work:** N/A at the moment.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
 - I learned more about div when doing the FreeCodeCamp lessons, so I decided to spruce up my basic page and added divs in each section.
 - I found images and added a section which lists the links to those images.
 - I added three pictures to my website, but I am having trouble lining them up together using bootstrap. I will continue to work on   
   this issue tomorrow.
 
**Thoughts:** Still getting used to Bootstrap. Scratching my head and wondering what I am doing wrong...but tomorrow awaits! Time to 
               work on other stuff.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017
 
**Today's Progress**:
  - I figured out why my pictures were not lining up. It was seriously a stupid reason. I thought I had bootstrap installed, but 
   apparently not. Once I was able to do that, I was able to get them to line up.
  - I was playing around with lining up the pictures and I realized it would just be easier to make a jpeg of all the pictures I 
   wanted to add so it would look like a banner.

**Thoughts** I did get frustrated regarding the picture issue, but luckily I had an a-ha moment and realized the issue. I also need 
             to learn git sooner than later so I can make commits to my code.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
 - Learned the basics on using Git.
 - I committed yesterday's work to my repository. 
 - I added links for the "Regional Associations" and "Iyengar Yoga Blogs and Websites" sections.
 - I was going to add FontAwesome to my site,  but at this moment, I don't see why I need it.
 - I ended up adding Google Fonts to my site, and I will play around with that.
 
**Thoughts** Didn't have that many issues today. I have some baseline knowledge on using Git, so I will be using that from now on to update my work.

### Day 5: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
 - I am still getting the hang of using Git.
 - I added jQuery to my website but I didn't add any jQuery elements to my page yet.
 - I spent most of the time trying to figure out how to align the picture I have. 
 - For some reason I cannot get the text for the title any bigger than what it is. I will work more on this tomorrow.
 
 **Thoughts** The Google text size issue is seriously getting on my nerves. At least I figured out how to center the image. It wasn't 
              as easy as they make it in the tutorials!

### Day 6: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
 - I commented out of a lot of stuff so I can focus on working on adding wells to the "Regional Associations" section.
 - I finally figured out my issue with the title text size; I needed to remove the h1 tag.
 
**Thoughts** I didn't get much done because I was trying to figure out the wells issue. The main issue was just based on syntax so I really need to make sure to watch that when adding classes to divs!
