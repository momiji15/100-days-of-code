# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
 - I decided to make a tribute page about B.K.S. Iyengar who is considered to be the "father of modern yoga." 
 - Started to work on some of the design elements. I will definitely update it as I learn more from FreeCodeCamp. 
 - In addition, I Made the headings for each section of the page.
 - Added a list of books and links.

**Thoughts:** The biggest struggle for today was figuring out who to do my Tribute Page on!

**Link to work:** N/A at the moment.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
 - I learned more about div when doing the FreeCodeCamp lessons, so I decided to spruce up my basic page and added divs in each section.
 - I found images and added a section which lists the links to those images.
 - I added three pictures to my website, but I am having trouble lining them up together using bootstrap. I will continue to work on   
   this issue tomorrow.
 
**Thoughts:** Still getting used to Bootstrap. Scratching my head and wondering what I am doing wrong...but tomorrow awaits! Time to 
               work on other stuff.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017
 
**Today's Progress**:
  - I figured out why my pictures were not lining up. It was seriously a stupid reason. I thought I had bootstrap installed, but 
   apparently not. Once I was able to do that, I was able to get them to line up.
  - I was playing around with lining up the pictures and I realized it would just be easier to make a jpeg of all the pictures I 
   wanted to add so it would look like a banner.

**Thoughts** I did get frustrated regarding the picture issue, but luckily I had an a-ha moment and realized the issue. I also need 
             to learn git sooner than later so I can make commits to my code.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
 - Learned the basics on using Git.
 - I committed yesterday's work to my repository. 
 - I added links for the "Regional Associations" and "Iyengar Yoga Blogs and Websites" sections.
 - I was going to add FontAwesome to my site,  but at this moment, I don't see why I need it.
 - I ended up adding Google Fonts to my site, and I will play around with that.
 
**Thoughts** Didn't have that many issues today. I have some baseline knowledge on using Git, so I will be using that from now on to update my work.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
 - I am still getting the hang of using Git.
 - I added jQuery to my website but I didn't add any jQuery elements to my page yet.
 - I spent most of the time trying to figure out how to align the picture I have. 
 - For some reason I cannot get the text for the title any bigger than what it is. I will work more on this tomorrow.
 
**Thoughts** The Google text size issue is seriously getting on my nerves. At least I figured out how to center the image. It wasn't 
              as easy as they make it in the tutorials!

### Day 6: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
 - I commented out of a lot of stuff so I can focus on working on adding wells to the "Regional Associations" section.
 - I finally figured out my issue with the title text size; I needed to remove the h1 tag.
 
**Thoughts** I didn't get much done because I was trying to figure out the wells issue. The main issue was just based on syntax so I really need to make sure to watch that when adding classes to divs!

### Day 7: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
- I updated the color scheme of the website.
- I added wells from all of the sections except for the "What is Iyengar Yoga?" section.

**Thoughts** Things went a lot more smoothly today compared to the other the days. I'm hoping to finish this project by the end of the week. At this point, I just need to do a little research and add content to the biography and "What is Iyengar Yoga" sections!

### Day 8: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
- I added information and a picture to the "Who is B.K.S. Iyengar" section.
- I reduced the image in the "Who is B.K.S. Iyengar" section by 50%.
- I updated the "Image sources" section.

**Thoughts** I'm not gonna lie...given how busy my day was, it was difficult to just carve out an hour to code. But the page is coming along quite nicely, so I am happy about that! I am going to try to figure out a way to upload everything so people can see what progress I am making on the page. Newbie problems!

### Day 9: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
- I changed the "Who is B.K.S. Iyengar" section to include one well and one picture in each column.
- I added additional information and one picture in the "Who is B.K.S. Iyengar" section.
- I removed one of the wells in the "Sources" section. I will just have one column/well that will store both the image and other sources.

**Thoughts** Another busy day, but I still was able to get an hour of coding in 30 minutes before midnight! The hour went by quite fast and I'm glad I could add more information in the bio section!

### Day 10: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
 - I finished the "Who is B.K.S. Iyengar" section.
 - I finished the "What is Iyengar Yoga" section.
 - I added pictures to the "What is Iyengar Yoga" and the "Who is B.K.S. Iyengar" sections.
 - I added more sources under the "image sources" section.
 - I started working on the sources section regarding the content in the "What is Iyengar Yoga" and "Who is B.K.S. Iyengar" sections.
 
**Thoughts** Started late but smooth sailing! I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel with this project!

### Day 11: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
 - I updated the image sources to referencing them in APA style.
 - I added the sources for the "Who is B.K.S. Iyengar" and the "What is Iyengar Yoga" sections.
 - I created columns for all the headings so the heading text can completely be within the background color.
 
 **Thoughts** Again I started coding pretty late, but time flew by pretty quickly. Maybe I should just do my coding at night! I am happy that I was able to easily resolve the issue regarding the text "coming off" the background. Now that I made the changes, I need to tweak the spacing of the photos. I also want to tweak the spacing of the wells. Now that I got the major stuff done, I can start to fine tune the page. I seriously think it will be done within a couple of days!

### Day 12: January 14, 2017 

**Today's Progress**:
- I added a source that I forgot to add under the "Sources" section.
- I replaced the bullet points with a font aweseome icon for the unordered lists.
- I adjusted the margins of the rows to get rid of the "clashing" between the heading and the wells/pictures.
- I fixed an issue with the "Regional Associations" session. The links were the same on the left and right wells!
- Transfered code from Brackets to Codepen.io

**Thoughts** I am pretty much finished with this project. Since I did my work in Brackets, I needed to transfer it to Codepen and share it. I had to tweak what I did in codepen.io since the page was not displaying the same. I definitely spent more than the one hour I alloted to coding for the day. Almost tempted to count it for the next day since I worked pass midnight haha. I am pretty pleased with what I have done!

### Day 13: January 15, 2017 

**Today's Progress**:
- I added a target which would allow the link to load in a separate page.
- I added more columns in order to make the page more dynamic.
- I corrected a semantic error in the "Who is B.K.S. Iyengar?" section.

**Thoughts** I definitely worked at least two hours today, but I really wanted to finish this project off! I spent this time putting the final touches on this project. Tomorrow, I will start working on the FCC Portfolio project.

### Day 14: January 16, 2017 

**Today's Progress**:
- I started working on the FCC Portfolio Project.
- I added a navbar to my portfolio page.
- I messed some things up when using git. I uploaded the folder from the tribute repository to the portfolio repository and had to 
  delete the folder.
  
**Thoughts**
I really screwed up things when I changed directories in git and accidentally deleted the index.html file on my computer!!! The good news is that I was able to get the file again from the tribute page repository. I still find git quite confusing!!!

### Day 15: January 17, 2017 

**Today's Progress**:
- Changed the navbar design.
- Added padding to the webpage.

**Thoughts**
Spent the whole hour working on the navbar...this project is definitely harder than the last one!

### Day 16: January 18, 2017 

**Today's Progress**:
- I messed around with my navbar....again.
- I changed the color of the navbar to black.
- I changed the font and font color of the navbar items.
- I changed the font when one hovers over a navbar element.

**Thoughts**
Spent yet another hour working on the navbar.....I blame being fickle for that. But I think I am satisfied...for now with what I have. I just need to figure out how to change the color of the font of the navbar element when it is an active. I definitely did a lot of Google searches today regarding CSS and the bootstrap nav bar!!!!

### Day 17: January 19, 2017 

**Today's Progress**:
- I was able to get the text to turn black when one clicks on the pill in the nav-bar.
- I changed the background of the web page.
- I added a title and sub-title for my page.

**Thoughts**
The good news is that I did not spend the whole hour working on the navbar. The not so good news is that I really have no idea where I want to go with this portfolio page. I'm going to have to get out the pen and paper and draw up what kind of design I would like...that will be my blueprint to work off of! I had trouble remembering how to add the row and column elements to the page. It's crazy how quickly the code can fly out of your brain! I guess this is why the 100 Days of Code challenge is so important!

### Day 18: January 20, 2017 

**Today's Progress**:
- I added objects to my page and added links to my objects to the pill elements. When I click on a pill, it will scroll down to the 
  corresponding object.
- I added something to the "About Me" section.

**Thoughts**
I typed the midnight code today...this is probably the latest I ever coded. Pretty pleased with my progress though.

### Day 19: January 21, 2017 

**Today's Progress**:
- I fixed the rows and columns for the "About Me" section.
- I added an image placeholder in the "About Me" section.
- I added a "Portfolio" section.
- I added image placeholders in the "Portfolio" section.

**Thoughts**
Had a few issues regarding padding the columns but I was able to figure it out. For some reason when I try to add a row and add a h3 heading, everything messes up. I will try to figure that out tomorrow!

### Day 20: January 22, 2017 

**Today's Progress**:
- I fixed the issue with the "Portfolio" h3 heading.
- I added a "Contact" section.
- I played around with adding a form to the "Contact" section.

**Thoughts**
I'm happy that I was able to fix the h3 issue. The next task is to figure out forms.

### Day 21: January 23, 2017  
**Today's Progress**:
- I scrapped the form that I originally made and made a new one.

**Thoughts**
Making a form is a lot harder than I thought...spent most of my time figuring out the best way to do it. I am reading terms like AJAX and PHP and those terms are Greek to me :/

### Day 22: January 24, 2017
**Today's Progress**:
- I scrapped the form because I didn't feel like shelling out money for a hosting site and provided a link to my e-mail in the "Contact" 
  section.
- I added links to my social media accounts.

**Thoughts**
Pretty smooth sailing today. Creating a form was more complicated than I thought. On top of that, as previously mentioned, there is some cost in doing so, so forget it for the time being!

### Day 23: January 25, 2017
**Today's Progress**:
- I added more information to the "Portfolio" section.
- I added smooth scrolling to the webpage.

**Thoughts**
Adding smooth scrolling was easier than I thought. I am trying to figure out what do I want to put in my "Portfolio" section. Other than that, I feel like at this pace, I should be able to wrap this project up within a week or so!

### Day 24: January 26, 2017
**Today's Progress**:
-I added a "GIS-Visualization-GeoDataScience" section and gave a description of a project.
-I added a "Training" section and gave a description of a project.
-I added a profile picture.

**Thoughts**
Now that I added more to my "Portfolio" section, the smooth scrolling + going to linked objects within the page is a bit off. For example, when I click down on the "Contact Me" section, it does not go down to that section but rather to part of the "Portfolio" section. Yet another thing I have to figure out!!!

### Day 25: January 27, 2017
**Today's Progress**:
- Added images to the "GIS-Visualization-GeoDataScience" section.
- Added images to the "Training" section.
- Added image placeholdersto the "Miscelleanous" section.

**Thoughts**
Today was indeed hard...not because of the coding persay, but because I am exhausted!

### Day 26: January 28, 2017
**Today's Progress**:
- Added images to the "Public Health" sub-heading in the "Portfolio" section.
- Started to migrate the code to codepen.io

**Thoughts**
I feel like I will be finished with the portfolio in a couple of days!

### Day 27: January 29, 2017
**Today's Progress**
- Finished migrating my code from Brackets to Codepen.io.

**Thoughts**
I could say that I'm done with my portfolio page, but I want to introduce media queries in order for it to be a responsive design. Hoping I can figure out and this be my final week working on the portfolio project!

**Link to work:** [Portfolio Page](http://codepen.io/momiji15/full/apVXVZ/)

### Day 28: January 30, 2017
**Today's Progress**
- Added media queries to both my portfolio and the B.K.S. Iyengar tribute site.

**Thoughts**
I am almost finished with the portfolio project, but there is one more kink I have to deal with. The website looks fine on a desktop and a tablet, but is a little off on my portfolio! Hopefully I can figure it out tomorrow so I can wrap up this project!!! 

**Link to work:** [Portfolio Page](http://codepen.io/momiji15/full/apVXVZ/)


### Day 29: January 31, 2017
**Today's Progress**
- Corrected a grammar error in the "About me" section.
- Fixed the issues with the contact icon links. When you click on it, it will go to an external page.
- Added more padding in the sections.

**Thoughts**
I had a friend look at my page and he gave me some great feedback. I went ahead and made those changes based on his feedback. I thought I would be finished today, but maybe I will be finished by the end of this week...haha.

**Link to work:** [Portfolio Page](http://codepen.io/momiji15/full/apVXVZ/)

### Day 30: February 1, 2017
**Today's Progress**
- Still unsuccessful with having media queries work with my iphone.

**Thoughts**
Getting frustrated regarding media queries since I am almost done with my portfolio and this is the only thing I need get to work properly. My friend recommended Flexbox so I will take a look at that.

**Link to work:** [Portfolio Page](http://codepen.io/momiji15/full/apVXVZ/)


### Day 31: February 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**
- Screwed up my portfolio thanks to trying to figure out the media queries issue.

**Thoughts**
The frustration continues...

**Link to work:** [Portfolio Page](http://codepen.io/momiji15/full/apVXVZ/)

### Day 32: February 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**
- Taking a break from the Portfolio page and worked on the "Profile Lookup" challenge on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**
I'm counting the "Profile Looking" challenge towards my hour of code since it's a challenge that needs to be solved as opposed to "type and click 'Run Tests.'" For how tired I am, I am making some progresss on it.

### Day 33: February 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**
- Finished the "Profile Lookup" challenge on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**
Ended up having to consult the discussion forums to figure it out. I was so close. Once I got rid of some extraneous information in the for loop, it worked!

### Day 34: February 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**
- Repaired the damage I made on my Portfolio page a few days ago.
- Changed all the columns to small.

**Thoughts**
Glad that I was able to fix the damage I did on my page. Tomorrow's another day!

**Link to Work** [Portfolio Page](http://codepen.io/momiji15/full/apVXVZ/)

### Day 35: February 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**
- Repaired the offset issue in the "Contact" section.
- Added a collapsible navbar.

**Thoughts**
Now I understand what is meant by a collapsible navbar! Now the main issue is that the links are not working in the navbar. That will be what I work on tomorrow!

**Link to Work** [Portfolio Page](http://codepen.io/momiji15/full/apVXVZ/)

### Day 36: February 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**
- Screwed up my page and salvaged it(again).
- Changed the collapsible navbar but the links still don't work.

**Thoughts**
Totally didn't mean to spend THREE HOURS on this issue. Super frustrated.

**Link to Work** [Portfolio Page](http://codepen.io/momiji15/full/apVXVZ/)

### Day 37: February 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**
Still working on the issue regarding the navbar links not working on the iPhone. 

**Thoughts**
I feel like I'm getting close, but I've said that before. 

**Link to Work** [Portfolio Page](http://codepen.io/momiji15/full/apVXVZ/)

### Day 38: February 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**
Realized my navbar links is a CodePen issue and not an issue with my code.

**Thoughts**
Yesterday was a crazy day, so before I knew it, I was too tired to get some coding in. The good news about today is that I figured the issue with the mobile nav links out. The bad news is that I wasted over a week trying to figure it out.

**Link to Work** [Portfolio Page](http://codepen.io/momiji15/full/apVXVZ/)

### Day 39: February 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**
Started to work on getting the divs at the same size.

**Thoughts**
Easier said than done!

**Link to Work** [Portfolio Page](http://codepen.io/momiji15/full/apVXVZ/)

### Day 40: February 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**
Still working on getting the divs the same size.

**Thoughts**
Will start back to coding one hour a day as of tomorrow.

**Link to Work** [Portfolio Page](http://codepen.io/momiji15/full/apVXVZ/)


### Day 41: February 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**
- I was able to get matchHeight.js to work!
- I changed the pictures to be formatted by percent as opposed to px

**Thoughts**
By changing the pictures to be formatted by percent, I was able to get the page to fit better on a mobile interface. I need to figure out the whitespace issue though.

**Link to Work** [Portfolio Page](http://codepen.io/momiji15/full/apVXVZ/)

### Day 42: February 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**
- Fixed the mobile dropdown menu

**Thoughts**
Trying to fine tune the mobile interface.

**Link to Work** [Portfolio Page](http://codepen.io/momiji15/full/apVXVZ/)

### Day 43: February 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**
- Not much. 

**Thoughts**
- The columns not being the same width is driving me crazy!

### Day 44: February 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**
- I was able to fix the white spaces between the rows.

**Thoughts**
- I'm glad that I was able to fix the white spaces...it took me a while! Now I need to fix the issues regarding the nav bar scrolling to the appropriate part of the webpage. I'm thinking that is a padding issue. I also need to fix a spacing issue with the "Geovisualization..." section of the page as well.
