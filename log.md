# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
 - I decided to make a tribute page about B.K.S. Iyengar who is considered to be the "father of modern yoga." 
 - Started to work on some of the design elements. I will definitely update it as I learn more from FreeCodeCamp. 
 - In addition, I Made the headings for each section of the page.
 - Added a list of books and links.

**Thoughts:** The biggest struggle for today was figuring out who to do my Tribute Page on!

**Link to work:** N/A at the moment.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
 - I learned more about div when doing the FreeCodeCamp lessons, so I decided to spruce up my basic page and added divs in each section.
 - I found images and added a section which lists the links to those images.
 - I added three pictures to my website, but I am having trouble lining them up together using bootstrap. I will continue to work on this  
   issue tomorrow.
   
 **Thoughts:** Still getting used to Bootstrap. Scratching my head and wondering what I am doing wrong...but tomorrow awaits! Time to work                on other stuff.
 
 **Link to work:** Working on it right now...
