# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
I started messing around with the Blogdown package in attempt to create a personal website(second take). I successfully decided on a template and made a new site. I am using [Creating Websites With Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) to try to figure this all out.
 

**Thoughts:** 
Again, I am burning the midnight oil due to troubleshooting. I had some initial problems with starting a new site, but I guess sleep deprivation prevented me from processing the sentence about everything needing to be in an empty directory. I am happy I at least got the page loading. I am going to pay for staying up this late this tomorrow at my  morning Brazilian Jiu Jitsu session at 7:30, which will be the first time I did BJJ in a bit. I know that has nothing to do with coding, but where's the lie in that statement. 

**Link to work:** 
I am not in the mood nor have the extra energy to expend to mess around with GitHub other than modifying this page, so you're going to have to wait ;).
