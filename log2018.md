# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
I started messing around with the Blogdown package in attempt to create a personal website(second take). I successfully decided on a template and made a new site. I am using [Creating Websites With Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) to try to figure this all out.
 

**Thoughts:** 
Again, I am burning the midnight oil due to troubleshooting. I had some initial problems with starting a new site, but I guess sleep deprivation prevented me from processing the sentence about everything needing to be in an empty directory. I am happy I at least got the page loading. I am going to pay for staying up this late this tomorrow at my  morning Brazilian Jiu Jitsu session at 7:30, which will be the first time I did BJJ in a bit. I know that has nothing to do with coding, but where's the lie in that statement. 

**Link to work:** 
I am not in the mood nor have the extra energy to expend to mess around with GitHub other than modifying this page, so you're going to have to wait ;).

### Day 2: April 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
I worked on trying to deploy my site which involves GitHub and Netlify. I really didn't get that far. After accidentally deleting my site, I successfully did upload the files on my github repo. 
 

**Thoughts:** 
The struggle with me and GitHub continues. I was feeling good about myself but have been beaten down due to trying to deploy this website on Netlify which is apparently supposed to be easy. While the blogdown book says that it only takes a few minutes to deploy a site...I worked over an hour to get it done and I still wasn't able to. The lies, the lies, the lies. Really it would be wise to stray away from giving such time limits given coders of a variety of abilities try to work through these things. Given that I worked 1.5 hours on this...I will be deducting that from my one hour of coding tomorrow.

### Day 3: April 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
I finally was able to deploy my site on Netlify. My issue was that I did not have the version of Hugo needed to deploy the site. I'm sure I would have caught that earlier if I wasn't running on E. No burning the midnight oil today due to coding!
 

**Thoughts:** 
I will most probably change the domain name for my site, but this will do for now. I will say the domain name given to me puts a smile on my face.

### Day 4: April 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Added content to my blog.
- Added information in the about page.
 

**Thoughts:** 
I did add content to two pages....but having a bit of a problem...updating the site! I tried deploying my site and I failed. So after on hour and 45 minutes on this...it's time to put it down and go to bed. And this is totally being deducted from the next two of days of coding.

Did do commits to my repo: https://github.com/momiji15/dscott/tree/master/public

### Day 5: April 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
I have little time today because tonight is UFC 223 but given how much time I spent yesterday on my code, I just docked off that time today. Today's short coding session was dedicated to salvaging my blog post that I accidentally deleted through reverting commits and maybe some other things in which I have the slightest idea what I did. I'm satisfied that I at least pushed my blog post to my repo, but still am having problems with deploying the site.
 

**Thoughts:** 
I can't even get too upset because I am in UFC fight night mode. I will deal with it tomorrow.

### Day 6: April 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Learned how to remove files on my GitHub repository but keep those files locally
- Got my site to work locally

**Thoughts:** 
I'm going to try to start as much from square one as I can before I just throw my hands up and just start anew. I deleted some of my folders in my GitHub repo. I didn't know how to do that, so I consulted my friend Google to teach me how. I have no idea what I did, but now my blogdown site is able to build locally through the serve_site() function. Before, I was getting some error message about the the local directory not being changed. I just added a url to the config.toml and commented out the publishDir and somehow it all worked. Still don't get why though.


**Link to work:** 
Nothing to show regarding my blog, BUT I did update my page on how to know how to do things with GitHub so that's at least something:
