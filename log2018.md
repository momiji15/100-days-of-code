# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
I started messing around with the Blogdown package in attempt to create a personal website(second take). I successfully decided on a template and made a new site. I am using [Creating Websites With Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) to try to figure this all out.
 

**Thoughts:** 
Again, I am burning the midnight oil due to troubleshooting. I had some initial problems with starting a new site, but I guess sleep deprivation prevented me from processing the sentence about everything needing to be in an empty directory. I am happy I at least got the page loading. I am going to pay for staying up this late this tomorrow at my  morning Brazilian Jiu Jitsu session at 7:30, which will be the first time I did BJJ in a bit. I know that has nothing to do with coding, but where's the lie in that statement. 

**Link to work:** 
I am not in the mood nor have the extra energy to expend to mess around with GitHub other than modifying this page, so you're going to have to wait ;).

### Day 2: April 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
I worked on trying to deploy my site which involves GitHub and Netlify. I really didn't get that far. After accidentally deleting my site, I successfully did upload the files on my github repo. 
 

**Thoughts:** 
The struggle with me and GitHub continues. I proved victorious but have been beaten down due to trying to deploy this website on Netlify which is apparently supposed to be easy. While the blogdown book says that it only takes a few minutes to deploy a site...I worked over an hour to get it done and I still wasn't able to. The lies, the lies, the lies. Really it would be wise to stray away from giving such time limits given coders of a variety of abilities try to work through these things.
