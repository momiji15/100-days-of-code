# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
I started messing around with the Blogdown package in attempt to create a personal website(second take). I successfully decided on a template and made a new site. I am using [Creating Websites With Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) to try to figure this all out.
 

**Thoughts:** 
Again, I am burning the midnight oil due to troubleshooting. I had some initial problems with starting a new site, but I guess sleep deprivation prevented me from processing the sentence about everything needing to be in an empty directory. I am happy I at least got the page loading. I am going to pay for staying up this late this tomorrow at my  morning Brazilian Jiu Jitsu session at 7:30, which will be the first time I did BJJ in a bit. I know that has nothing to do with coding, but where's the lie in that statement. 

**Link to work:** 
I am not in the mood nor have the extra energy to expend to mess around with GitHub other than modifying this page, so you're going to have to wait ;).

### Day 2: April 4, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
I worked on trying to deploy my site which involves GitHub and Netlify. I really didn't get that far. After accidentally deleting my site, I successfully did upload the files on my github repo. 
 

**Thoughts:** 
The struggle with me and GitHub continues. I was feeling good about myself but have been beaten down due to trying to deploy this website on Netlify which is apparently supposed to be easy. While the blogdown book says that it only takes a few minutes to deploy a site...I worked over an hour to get it done and I still wasn't able to. The lies, the lies, the lies. Really it would be wise to stray away from giving such time limits given coders of a variety of abilities try to work through these things. Given that I worked 1.5 hours on this...I will be deducting that from my one hour of coding tomorrow.

### Day 3: April 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
I finally was able to deploy my site on Netlify. My issue was that I did not have the version of Hugo needed to deploy the site. I'm sure I would have caught that earlier if I wasn't running on E. No burning the midnight oil today due to coding!
 

**Thoughts:** 
I will most probably change the domain name for my site, but this will do for now. I will say the domain name given to me puts a smile on my face.

### Day 4: April 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 
- Added content to my blog.
- Added information in the about page.
 

**Thoughts:** 
I did add content to two pages....but having a bit of a problem...updating the site! I tried deploying my site and I failed. So after on hour and 45 minutes on this...it's time to put it down and go to bed. And this is totally being deducted from the next two of days of coding. 

**Link to work:** 
Did do commits to my repo: https://github.com/momiji15/dscott/tree/master/public

### Day 5: April 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 
I have little time today because tonight is UFC 223 but given how much time I spent yesterday on my code, I just docked off that time today. Today's short coding session was dedicated to salvaging my blog post that I accidentally deleted through reverting commits and maybe some other things in which I have the slightest idea what I did. I'm satisfied that I at least pushed my blog post to my repo, but still am having problems with deploying the site.
 

**Thoughts:** 
I can't even get too upset because I am in UFC fight night mode. I will deal with it tomorrow.

### Day 6: April 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 
- Learned how to remove files on my GitHub repository but keep those files locally
- Got my site to work locally

**Thoughts:** 
I'm going to try to start as much from square one as I can before I just throw my hands up and just start anew. I deleted some of my folders in my GitHub repo. I didn't know how to do that, so I consulted my friend Google to teach me how. I have no idea what I did, but now my blogdown site is able to build locally through the serve_site() function. Before, I was getting some error message about the the local directory not being changed. I just added a url to the config.toml and commented out the publishDir and somehow it all worked. Still don't get why though.


**Link to work:** 
Nothing to show regarding my blog, BUT I did update my page on how to know how to do things with GitHub so that's at least something:
https://github.com/momiji15/gittingit/blob/master/howto.md

### Day 7: April 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 
- Remove the Projects section on my site for the time being.
- Adding a profile photo.
- Successfully deployed my site!

**Thoughts:** 
After one week of working on my personal site, I finally have successfully updated and deployed my site! I found out that what was triggering the error message was the `publishDir` command that I had in my `config.toml` file. From reading the documentation, I somehow got the idea that it was necessary, but it's actually not if you use Netlify to deploy the site. I'm assuming this is only when you want to create a public folder locally and you want to drag the folder to Netlify(which is an option for those who are not familiar with GitHub. 

I would also like to give props to [Peter Baumgartner](https://notes.peter-baumgartner.net/tutorial/blogdown-tutorial-part-1/) on his very good tutorial on how to get a blogdown site up and running.

Personal website is finally up and running!!!

### Day 8: April 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
- Did some reconfiguring of the Projects section which involved deleting the "Writing" section and adding a "Projects and Courses" 
  section.
- Figured out how to do external links to other pages.

**Thoughts:**
I almost thought I wouldn't be able to use the theme for my personal website because I couldn't figure out the external links thing, but lo and behold I figured it out. Slowly but surely I'm getting the hang of blogdown!

### Day 9: April 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
- Added a "GIS and Data Science" section in the Projects part of my website.
- Added some new images.

**Thoughts:**
It was kind of a pain to link the images on the websites, but it seems that once I got rid of the numbers in the file name it worked.

### Day 10: April 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
- Scrapped the "GIS and Data Science" section in the Projects part of my website.
- Added a NASA DEVELOP part in the Projects part of my website.

**Thoughts:**
1/10th of the way done with the challenge!!! I was somewhat tempted to drop this current web design because I really hate how big the pictures are in the Projects section, however I decided to take a different approach to my Projects page. Instead of working against the design of the template, I decided to work with the design. I will add each project separately with a corresponding image instead of grouping them all in one section.

### Day 11: April 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
- Added a Data Science for Social Good - Atlanta part in the Projects part of my website.

**Thoughts:**
Since I worked 1.5 hours yesterday on this page, I only coded for 30 minutes today. Kind of all worked itself out since I was extremely busy today and had to do some midnight coding. Making some steady progress on my personal page so I am pleased so far.

## Day 12: April 14, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
- Added disqus to my website.
- Updated the photography page.

**Thoughts:**
A little bit under the weather today so I made sure to stop at exactly an hour. Tomorrow I will finish off working ony website for the time being and add a blog post and then I will  move on to focus on improving a Shiny app. I've been doing the Shiny course in DataCamp to better understand the framework, and I am already having some ideas on how some things(i.e. undoing some of the hard coding of categories in a dropdown menu and having it self-populate) so I'll test those waters starting tomorrow.

## Day 13: April 15, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
- Added a blog post about the conference I attended.
- Forked a repo for a project I will be working on to my GitHub.

**Thoughts:**
Still under the weather so I didn't do much, but I still allocated an hour to do the work. I am trying to figure out how to use GitHub via RStudio and I have been looking at [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com/) by Jenny Bryan and the TAs from the STATS 545 class. I am just o...k...a...y with doing it from the command line. Well I get what I need to get done, done so that's good enough for me. I will start to get cracking with this project on updating a Shiny app tomorrow and see what's going on with the code.

## Day 14: April 17, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
- Looking under the hood of this Athens Social Atlas Shiny App

**Thoughts:**
Slow progress today...just trying to learn the ins and outs of the app. I cannot get it to work on my computer so I am working on trying to get it to work.

**Link to Work:**
None yet!

## Day 15: April 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
- Got the variable descriptions to load dynamically in the dropdown menu for the Athens Social Atlas Shiny App

**Thoughts:**
To be honest, it's been a rough couple of days since I've been sick. I wasn't able to do anything yesterday, but I picked it up back today. This is the first day I actually feel somewhat decent. I am pleasantly surprised that I was able to figure out one piece of the puzzle rather quickly. The main issue at hand with the Athens Social Atlas app is to get the variable descriptions to load dynamically. Thanks to what I have learned so far in the Building Web Applications with Shiny DataCamp course, I was able to figure it out. I have a feeling if I keep on going, I can figure out the second part of the puzzle, which is to get the descriptions to load dynamically based on a filter. It's extremely gratifying to see what you learn actually be applied to tackle an issue!

**Link to Work:**
None yet, but I can promise you I saw a dropdown menu with some descriptions that were not hard-coded :).

## Day 16: April 20, 2018
**Today's Progress:**
- Came up with a rough way to have the data subsetted by category and have the variable descriptions to load dynamically.

**Thoughts:**
I think I might have figured out the first task with updating the app. The first task to do with this app has to do with having the variable descriptions to be loaded dynamically. One piece of this is to make sure the data is filtered first by category (Crime, Safety, etc) and then have the descriptions to be loaded dynamically. It's a "rough" workaround, but I got it to work for one category and reduces the lines of code too. Tomorrow I'm going to continue on and see what happens.

**Link to Work:** 
None yet, sowee!! You'll just have to take my words for it!
